    <p>This is my web page. There are many like it but this one is mine.</p>
    <p>I’m using the HyperText Markup Language (<dfn>HTML</dfn>) to give structure to this page.</p>
    <p>For example, this text is inside a paragraph which is inside an article which is inside the main content.</p>
    <p>For the tangential information that follows, I’m using the <code>aside</code> element.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Did you know that <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">the first web page ever made</a> is still online at its original URL?</p>
    <p>The page was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 90s and it still works in a modern web browser.</p>
